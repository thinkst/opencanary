Windows Server
================

The Samba and RDP modules require an extra installation step. It's a
good idea to consult the `README <https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary>`_ before trying this out.

Inside ~/.opencanary.conf:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "smb.auditfile": "/var/log/samba-audit.log",
       "smb.enabled": true
   }

Below is an example of an `smb.conf` for a Samba installation, 

.. code-block:: json

    [global]
       workgroup = WORKGROUP
       server string = blah
       netbios name = SRV01
       dns proxy = no
       log file = /var/log/samba/log.all
       log level = 0
       vfs object = full_audit
       full_audit:prefix = %U|%I|%i|%m|%S|%L|%R|%a|%T|%D
       full_audit:success = pread
       full_audit:failure = none
       full_audit:facility = local7
       full_audit:priority = notice
       max log size = 100
       panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d
       #samba 4
       server role = standalone server
       #samba 3
       #security = user
       passdb backend = tdbsam
       obey pam restrictions = yes
       unix password sync = no
       map to guest = bad user
       usershare allow guests = yes
    [myshare]
       comment = All the stuff!
       path = /home/demo/share
       guest ok = yes
       read only = yes
       browseable = yes

Please note that there are some details in the above config that you would want to change,

* server string
* NetBIOS name
* [myshare] to the name of your share
* path

Of course, you may change other settings as long as the `smbd_audit` logs to the file that your
OpenCanary daemon is watching (above we set it as `/var/log/samba-audit.log`).

In the above config, we are relying on Samba using Syslog (rsyslog in newer systems). For our Samba
to use rsyslog, we will edit the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file. Below are two lines we add to the bottom,

.. code-block:: json

    $FileCreateMode 0644
    local7.*            /var/log/samba-audit.log

This will redirect any message of facility local7 to your `/var/log/samba-audit.log` file, which will be
watched by our OpenCanary daemon. 

Please note this is all written up in the GitHub README.md
