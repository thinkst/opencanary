Overview
----------

In essence, OpenCanary creates a network honeypot allowing you to catch hackers before they fully compromise your systems. As a technical definition, OpenCanary is a daemon that runs several canary versions of services that alerts when a service is (ab)used.

Features
----------

* Receive email alerts as soon as potential threats are detected, highlighting the threat source IP address and where the breach may have taken place.

Prerequisites
----------------

* Python 2.7, 3.7 (Recommended python 3.7+)
* [Optional] SNMP requires the python library scapy
* ~[Optional] RDP requires the python library rdpy~ (this module has been removed; we are currently determing a way forward with this.)
* [Optional] Samba module needs a working installation of samba

Installation [UBUNTU]
----------

For updated and cleaner documentation, please head over to http://opencanary.org

Installation on Ubuntu 20.04:
(Please note that although we support python 2.7; these instructions are aimed at running the python 3 version)

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip python3-virtualenv python3-venv python3-scapy libssl-dev libpcap-dev
$ sudo apt install samba # if you plan to use the smb module
$ virtualenv env/
$ . env/bin/activate
$ pip install opencanary
$ pip install scapy pcapy # optional
```
Installation [OS X]
----------

Installation OS X needs an extra step, as multiple OpenSSL versions
may exist which confounds the python libraries using to it.

```
$ virtualenv env/
$ . env/bin/activate
```

Macports users should then run:
```
$ sudo port install openssl
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" pip install cryptography
```

Alternatively homebrew users run:

If Macbook is x86:
````
$ brew install openssl
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" pip install cryptography
````

if Macbook is M1:
```
$ brew install openssl
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch arm64" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib" CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/include" pip install cryptography
```

Now installation can run as usual:
```
$ pip install opencanary
$ pip install scapy pcapy # optional
```
Installation [GIT]
----------

To install from source, instead of running pip do the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary
$ cd opencanary
$ python setup.py sdist
$ cd dist
$ pip install opencanary-<version>.tar.gz
```

If you are looking to get OpenCanary working on OpenBSD, take a look at https://github.com/8com/opencanary.

Running OpenCanary
----
Please note that for the Portscan service, we have added an `portscan.ignore_localhost` setting which means the Opencanary `portscan` service will ignore (not alert on) portscans originating for the localhost IP (`127.0.0.1`). This setting is false by default.

OpenCanary is started by running:

```
$ . env/bin/activate
$ opencanaryd --start
```

On the first run, instructions are printed that will get to a working config.

```
$ opencanaryd --copyconfig
```

Which will create a folder, `/etc/opencanaryd` and a config file inside that folder `opencanary.conf`. You must now edit the config file to determine which services and logging options you would like to enable.

When OpenCanary starts it looks for config files the following order:

1. ./opencanary.conf (i.e. the directory where OpenCanary is installed)
2. ~/.opencanary.conf (i.e. the home directory of the user, usually this will be root so /root/.opencanary.conf)
3. /etc/opencanaryd/opencanary.conf

It will use the first config file that exists.

Samba Setup (optional)
----------------------
This is required for the `smb` module.

Docker
----------------

To build the latest Docker image (based on the code on a given branch) run:

```bash
docker build -t opencanary -f Dockerfile.latest .
```

To build a Docker image based on what has been released in Pypi, run:

```bash
docker build -t opencanary -f Dockerfile.stable .
```
